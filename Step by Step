Overview
QoE for file transfers is primarily influenced by throughput, latency (RTT), and packet loss. This project shows how to collect these metrics using iperf3 and derive a simple QoE score to evaluate the user-perceived quality.

Requirements
Linux/macOS or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Python 3 (for parsing JSON)

iPerf3 (both client and server)

Internet or LAN test setup

# Install iperf3
sudo apt install iperf3        # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install iperf3            # macOS

# Install Python JSON parser if needed
pip install pandas

For the Server side
iperf3 -s -p 5202

For the Client side
iperf3 -c 10.111.101.75 -u -b 100M -t 10
or you can use the following command to save everything in JS file:
iperf3 -c 10.111.101.75 -u -b 100M -t 10 -J > result.json

QoE formula
QoE_UDP = a * log10(throughput + 1) - b * jitter - c * loss
