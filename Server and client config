For the server, it

The server is a Dell PowerEdge R740, a high-performance, enterprise-grade rack server designed for virtualization,  and large-scale workloads. 
VMware ESXi with an instant of Ubuntu Server 24.04, providing a secure, stable, and up-to-date Linux environment. We host the Iperf3 server on it.
We used the command 
iperf3 -s
---------------------------------------------------------

For teh client side, I used Macbook pro and run the following command:

while true; do
  iperf3 -c 192.168.128.50 -u -b 100M -t 10 -J >> result_filetransfer.json
  sleep 10
done

Explanation:
while true; do ... done: Infinite loop â€” repeats the enclosed commands forever until interrupted (Ctrl+C).

iperf3 -c 192.168.128.50: Runs iperf3 in client mode targeting IP 192.168.128.50.

-u: Uses UDP instead of TCP.

-b 100M: Sends traffic at 100 Mbps.

-t 10: Test duration is 10 seconds.

-J: Output in JSON format.

>> result_filetransfer.json: Appends the result to the file result_filetransfer.json.

sleep 10: Waits 10 seconds before starting the next iteration.
